# How to use

 ## Step 1 -
 ### Open back_ts_express and run 'npm install' + 'npm run dev'
 This will run the server on port 3000 
 If port 3000 is occupied, close any other processes using this port and restart the server. The client is configured to make requests to localhost:3000 specifically.

 ## Step 2 -
 ### Open front_vite_ts_react and run 'npm install' + 'npm run dev'
 The client can run on any port as CORS is configured to allow from any origin.

## Step 3 -
### Use the client to seed the database.
To seed the database, simply navigate to the landing page of the client and click the button to trigger a POST request to the API. This request will create and populate the SQLite database automatically for you

The app uses a lightweight SQLite database, so thereâ€™s no need to set up or configure a separate database server.
