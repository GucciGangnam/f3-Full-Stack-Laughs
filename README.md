# How to use

 ## Step 1 -
 ### Open back_ts_express and bash 'npm run dev'
 This will run the server on port 3000 
 If port 3000 is occupied, close any other processes using this port and restart the server. The client is configured to make requests to localhost:3000 specifically.

 ## Step 2 -
 ### Open front_vite_ts_react and bash 'npm run dev'
 The client can run on any port as CORS is configured to allow from any origin.

## Step 3 -
### Use the client to seed the database.
For user experience, the database is created and seeded in the server via an API POST request which can be made on the landing page of the client.
